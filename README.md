The Kadanes algorithm is based for maximum sum of minimum size subarray.
sumppose you have 4 numbers  -1 -2 -3 -4  here the maximum sum will be -1 
another example you have 6 numbers -5 4 6 -3 4 -1 here maximum sum will be 11 and the minimum sub array is [4 6 -3 4] 

we can solve it by O(n2) also we can solve it by O(n)

O(N)->

we will move towards by a loop from zerro to n and will check if the sum comming less then the intial we will not take it again we will start from the next one see the code you will understand better
